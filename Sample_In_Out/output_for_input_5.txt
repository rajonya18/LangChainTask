The Thing Description (TD) is an open information model that provides a unified way to describe the capabilities of IoT devices or services with their data models, functions, protocol usage, and metadata. It helps reduce the complexity of integrating IoT devices into IoT applications. The TD is a W3C recommendation, originating from the Web of Things initiative, aiming to increase interoperability in the IoT. It provides a human-readable and machine-interpretable interface description of an IoT device, with three kinds of Interaction Affordances: Property, Action, and Event, which enable devices to expose state, invoke functions, and describe event sources.
